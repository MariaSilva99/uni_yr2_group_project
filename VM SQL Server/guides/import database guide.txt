import db data (MySQL needs to be installed and running as a service):

in Github (download file):
- go to the folder of the database that you want to import (should be in VM SQL Server)
- click on the most recent .sql file
- click on the button "Raw"
- right-click and click "Save Page As..."
- choose the download location, name the file, and write ".sql" at the end, e.g. "db.sql"
- click "Save" and the file should be at the chosen location


in MySQL Workbench:
- connect to your pc's sql server
- create a db/schema called "helping_hand"
- go to "Server" tab
- click "Data Import"
- click "Import from Self-Contained File"
- find and choose the .sql file to import
- below on "Default Target Schema" select "helping_hand"
- click "Start Import"
- if necessary, refresh your schemas
- the imported db contents should be in the schema "helping_hand"


in console - Windows:
- in your C: drive, search for "mysql.exe"
- in console type "cd" and write the full directory to mysql.exe, e.g. "cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
- log in to your sql server using "mysql.exe -u<username> -p", where <username> is your sql server username
- enter your password if you have one
- create a db/schema called "helping_hand"
- type "use helping_hand;"
- type "source" followed by the full directory to the downloaded .sql file including the file name and format, e.g. "source C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\db.sql" (no ; at the end)
- the imported db contents should now be in your local server
