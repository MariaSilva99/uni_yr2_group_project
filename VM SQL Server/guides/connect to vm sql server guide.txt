connect to VM SQL Server:

- make sure you are either connected to Brunel's VPN or using the Horizon VM.
- note: Horizon VM doesn't have MySQL installed, therefore you can only use it to work directly with the Azure server from the command line.
- you won't be able to import or export databases using Horizon VM, only on a machine with MySQL installed - but you won't need to anyway.


in MySQL Workbench:
- click "+" next to MySQL Connections
- give the connection a name
- in hostname, write "172.31.82.102" (VM's IP), port should be "3306" and username "root" by default
- click on "Store in Vault..." and enter "CSgroup12!"
- click "OK"
- a connection to the VM SQL server should have been created
- click on it to access the server (this connection will be saved for future uses)


in MySQL Shell:
- write the following commands:
  - \connect root@172.31.82.102
  - \CSgroup12!
  - (i believe it asks you if you want to save the password here - accept it)
  - \sql
- you can now write your queries

- to disconnect and exit write:
  - \js
  - \disconnect
  - \quit


in console - Windows:
- write the following commands:
  - ssh root@172.31.82.102
  - (it will ask you if you are sure that you want to continue - type "yes")
  - CSgroup12!
  - (you should be inside the VM now)
  - mysql -u root -p
  - CSgroup12!
- you can now write your queries

- to disconnect and exit enter "exit" 3 times
