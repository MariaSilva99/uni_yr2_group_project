- in order to connect to Azure's SQL server, you need to be either using Brunel's VPN or the Horizon VM.
- i have made a guide on how to connect to the server through various interfaces, which can be found in the guides folder along with instructions on how to download .sql files,
import and export databases.
- note that you need to have MySQL installed in your machine in order to use the database(s) from your host.
- please upload the database(s) to Github if you've made any changes to it/them on your local server.
- please do try to access the VM SQL server directly, it makes things easier.
- let me know if you need any help or if something is wrong or doesn't work.
